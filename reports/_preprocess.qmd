## Data Preprocessing
Understanding and preparing the data is critical for building reliable models of Bitcoin transaction fees. Several challenges arise during this process. First, we detected outliers that may represent data entry errors or anomalies, such as BTC prices recorded as -1. Second, documentation from the data source is limited. Third, transaction behavior is expected to vary over time, with differences across weekdays and weekends, as well as possible seasonal patterns. Finally, relationships between variables like transaction volume and fee rates may hold important signals that require further exploration.

To address the issues, we begin by identifying and correcting outliers and abnormal values through data cleaning. We also inspect feature definitions and cross-validate them to understand how certain features are computed. Temporal patterns are explored by introducing time-based features such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. We further analyze the data for signs of seasonality, subject to the period covered. To capture relevant relationships, we compute correlations, for example, between transaction volumes and fee rates or between median and total fee rates, to uncover meaningful relationships. We also consider engineering new features, such as binary indicators for positive or negative network events, to capture additional signals relevant to fee dynamics. 

We select the “fastest fee” rate as the primary response variable, as it serves as a clear benchmark for users prioritizing transaction speed. Given the right-skewed nature of the fee distribution, we apply a logarithmic transformation to improve model performance. We address missing and abnormal values through data cleaning procedures. Finally, we engineer time-based features—such as hour of day and day of week—as well as indicators of mempool congestion to enrich the feature space for downstream modeling.
