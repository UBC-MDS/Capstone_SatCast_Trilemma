This project aims to develop a machine learning-based tool to forecast Bitcoin transaction fees over a 24-hour horizon. Existing tools are limited to short-term forecasts (1-6 blocks), which aren't sufficient for users planning batch transactions or optimizing timing. Our tool fills this gap by providing longer-term forecasts with confidence intervals to show forecast precision and reliability. We will compare baseline models like ARIMA and XGBoost with advanced models such as Prophet, DeepAR, and Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to ensure both accuracy and robustness. We ultimately plan to deploy the tool using AWS Lambda for real-time forecasts using mempool data such as transaction volume, fee rates, and network conditions.
