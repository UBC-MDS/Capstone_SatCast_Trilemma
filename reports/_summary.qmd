This project aims to develop a machine learning-based tool to forecast Bitcoin transaction fees over a 24-hour horizon. Existing tools are limited to short-term forecasts (1-6 blocks), which are insufficient for users planning batch transactions or optimizing timing. By incorporating confidence intervals, our system helps users assess both expected fees and their reliability. The tool will be deployed using AWS Lambda for real-time predictions based on mempool data, including transaction volume, fee rates, and network conditions. Baseline models such as ARIMA and XGBoost will be compared with advanced models like Prophet and DeepAR to ensure both accuracy and robustness.
