This section outlines the core data and methods used in our analysis, including data overview, preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation strategies for fee forecasting.

## Dataset Overview

We worked with a time series dataset constructed from 5-minute snapshots of the Bitcoin mempool ([mempool.space](https://mempool.space/)), collected between March 5 and May 12 2025 (@fig-mempool-gif). The mempool is a real-time queue of unconfirmed transactions that wait to be included in a block, which proves that the network has validated and recorded them on the blockchain. Each snapshot captures the network state at a specific moment, forming a time series that reflects both blockchain activity and shifting market demandâ€”the key drivers of transaction fee dynamics.

```{python}
#| label: fig-mempool-gif
#| fig-cap: "Visual illustration of Bitcoin mempool.space activity."
#| fig-align: "center"
#| dpi: 150

from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

gif_path = Path().resolve().parent.parent / "img" / "mempool.gif"
img = Image.open(gif_path)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Our primary target variable, the recommended *fastestFee* (in sats/vByte), represents the rate required for near-immediate confirmation and serves as the core signal for modeling. The dataset includes 61 features covering mempool activity, transaction volume, block statistics, mining difficulty, BTC price, and related indicators. For clarity, we grouped these into four categories (see @tbl-features), each representing a distinct aspect of network or market behavior that influences fee dynamics.
