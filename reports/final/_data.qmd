## Dataset Overview

We used data collected from [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) via their public API, capturing snapshots of the Bitcoin mempool every 5 minutes between March and May 2025. Each snapshot represents the network state at a given moment and includes metrics such as mempool congestion, transaction volume, block production, mining difficulty, and BTC price. These snapshots form a time series dataset that reflects both blockchain-level activity and market demand conditions.

The mempool serves as a waiting room for unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. Users compete to have their transactions included in upcoming blocks by attaching fees, and when congestion rises, miners prioritize higher-fee transactions. This dynamic makes mempool data a strong signal for fee forecasting.
