This section outlines the core techniques used in our analysis, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation strategies that guided our approach to fee forecasting.

## Dataset Overview

We worked with a time series dataset constructed from 5-minute snapshots of the Bitcoin mempool ([mempool.space](https://mempool.space/), @fig-mempool-gif), captured between March 5 and May 2025. The mempool is a real-time queue of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block, which serves as proof that the transactions have been validated and recorded on the blockchain. Each snapshot captures the network state at a given point in time and includes 61 features such as mempool congestion, transaction volume, block production, mining difficulty, and BTC price. These snapshots collectively form a time series that reflects both blockchain-level activity and evolving market demand conditionsâ€”capturing the key drivers of transaction fee dynamics.
