This section outlines the core techniques used in our analysis, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation strategies that guided our approach to fee forecasting.

## Dataset Overview

We worked with a time series dataset constructed from 5-minute snapshots of the Bitcoin mempool ([mempool.space](https://mempool.space/)), captured between March 5 and May 2025.(@fig-mempool-gif) The mempool is a real-time queue of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block, which serves as proof that the transactions have been validated and recorded on the blockchain. Each snapshot captures the network state at a given point in time and includes 61 features such as mempool congestion, transaction volume, block production, mining difficulty, and BTC price. These snapshots collectively form a time series that reflects both blockchain-level activity and evolving market demand conditionsâ€”capturing the key drivers of transaction fee dynamics.

```{python}
#| label: fig-mempool-gif
#| fig-cap: "Visual illustration of Bitcoin mempool.space activity."
#| fig-align: "center"
#| dpi: 150

from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

gif_path = Path().resolve().parent.parent / "img" / "mempool.gif"
img = Image.open(gif_path)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

To better understand the input features used for modeling, we grouped the features in our dataset into four major categories, as shown in @#tbl-features. These categories capture different aspects of network activity and market conditions that influence fee dynamics.
