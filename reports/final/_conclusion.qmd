This project sets out to forecast Bitcoin transaction fees 24 hours ahead. To ensure models respond appropriately to sudden fee surges, we developed a custom loss function that emphasizes spike behavior and structural accuracy. Through extensive experimentation across statistical models, tree-based learners, and deep sequence models, we found that Temporal Fusion Transformer is best-suited to capturing irregular spike patterns and outperformed other models in RMSE, MAPE and a the volatility-sensitive loss by 25–35%. The resulting system offers a flexible and transparent foundation that moves beyond average-point to support users, wallets, and infrastructure providers in making more informed decisions around transaction timing.

Despite these gains, several constraints remain. The dataset used spans just two months, limiting exposure to rare but impactful phenomena. Many features that help explain fee behavior—such as mempool congestion or block composition—are available only with a lag, reducing our ability to predict true leading signals. Furthermore, while deep models like TFT are powerful, they require regular retraining and high computational resources, which may constrain deployment or accessibility. Our custom loss function, though aligned with business needs, remains static due to limited time for deeper research and could be better tuned to balance volatility sensitivity and accuracy. Future work could expand historical coverage, incorporate off-chain or leading indicators, and refine the custom loss function for better spike detection. In addition, hybrid pipelines that first predict intermediate signals and feed them into the final forecasting model, along with uncertainty-aware forecasts, may enhance robustness and usability over time.
