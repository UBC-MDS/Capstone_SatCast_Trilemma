This project sets out to forecast Bitcoin transaction fees 24 hours ahead. To ensure models respond appropriately to sudden fee surges, we developed a custom loss function that emphasizes spike behavior and structural accuracy. Through extensive experimentation across statistical models, tree-based learners, and deep sequence models, we found that Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is best-suited to capturing irregular spike patterns and outperformed other models in RMSE, MAPE and a the volatility-sensitive loss by `{python} f"{min_improvement_pct:.0f}%"`â€“`{python} f"{max_improvement_pct:.0f}%"`. The resulting system offers a flexible and transparent foundation that moves beyond average-point to support users, wallets, and infrastructure providers in making more informed decisions around transaction timing.

Despite these gains, several constraints remain. The two-month dataset limits exposure to rare but impactful events. Key features that help explain fee behaviors are lagging and reduce predictive lead time. While deep models like TFT are effective, they require regular retraining and high compute, which may constrain deployment. The custom loss function, though aligned with project goals, remains static and could be further tuned for volatility sensitivity and accuracy. Future work could expand historical coverage, incorporate off-chain or leading indicators, and refine the custom loss function for better spike detection. In addition, hybrid pipelines that first predict intermediate signals and feed them into the final forecasting model, along with uncertainty-aware forecasts, may enhance robustness and usability over time.
