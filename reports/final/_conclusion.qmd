This project set out to address the challenge of forecasting Bitcoin transaction fees—a notoriously volatile and difficult-to-predict signal shaped by network congestion, user incentives, and unpredictable events. Recognizing the limitations of existing tools that offer only near-term, reactive guidance, we reframed the problem as one of volatility forecasting over a 24-hour horizon. Through extensive experimentation across statistical models, tree-based learners, and deep sequence models, we found that modern deep learning architectures—particularly the Temporal Fusion Transformer—are well-suited to capturing irregular spike patterns. The resulting system moves beyond average-point estimation to provide actionable foresight, helping users, wallets, and infrastructure providers make more informed decisions around transaction timing.
