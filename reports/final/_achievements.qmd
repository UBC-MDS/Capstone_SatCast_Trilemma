Our project addresses this gap by reframing fee prediction as a volatility-first, time-sensitive forecasting problem. For longer horizons, the timing and shape of fee spikes are often more actionable than precise point estimates. To capture these dynamics, we evaluate a diverse set of models: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES) [@holt1957forecasting; @winters1960forecasting], SARIMA [@box2015time], XGBoost [@chen2016xgboost], Prophet [@taylor2018prophet], DeepAR [@salinas2017deepar], and the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [@lim2019temporal]. These represent a progression from classical time series models to tree-based regressors and deep learning architectures. We assess them using both standard metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE) and a custom composite loss designed to penalize deviation from spike shape, timing, and volatility.

We find that TFT significantly outperforms other models, improving key evaluation metrics by 25–35% over baseline approaches. This demonstrates its ability to model non-periodic fee behavior and support forward-looking decision-making. The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Section III outlines the data science techniques used, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation strategy. Section IV presents the data product and results, detailing model performance, intended use, and the system’s extensibility. Section V concludes with key takeaways, limitations, and recommendations for future development.
