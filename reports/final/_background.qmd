In the Bitcoin network, transaction fees[^note] fluctuate sharply due to irregular, off-chain events—such as network congestion, protocol updates, or Non-Fungible Token (NFT) inscription surges—rather than stable, recurring patterns. This fluctuation has led to daily transaction fees reaching over $78 million [@harper2024bitcoin], inefficient fee spending accumulating to over $272 million, and average 7.4 times more miner income variance [@basu2019towards]. As a result, short-term fee selection has become a high-stakes challenge for both users and infrastructure providers [@wang2025ordinals]

Prior work has made important progress in identifying key determinants of Bitcoin fees, such as network congestion and transaction complexity [@fan2020bitcoin]. Building on this foundation, more recent research has explored theoretical models of fee formation [@glaser2023equilibrium] and applied machine learning techniques to short-term fee estimation, such as using mempool-based features to track congestion in real time [@nair2022optimizing]. Tools like Bitcoin Core’s [estimatesmartfee]("https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/estimatesmartfee.html") [@estimatesmartfee] and [Mempool.space]("https://mempool.space") [@mempool] have also been widely adopted for near-term guidance, offering fast, lightweight heuristics suited for integration into wallets and clients. 

However, these approaches remain limited in scope: most focus only on the next 1–6 blocks (~10 minutes per block) and rely exclusively on recent block data. Their methodologies are often opaque, unresponsive to external volatility triggers, and not designed to anticipate sudden shifts. As a result, most public tools and research underemphasize the temporal structure and volatility dynamics that matter most to users planning beyond the immediate horizon [@li2020survey], leaving a critical planning gap unaddressed.
