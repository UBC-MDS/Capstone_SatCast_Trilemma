In the Bitcoin network, transaction fees fluctuate sharply due to congestion, shifting incentives, and user behavior. These spikes are driven by irregular, event-based shocks — such as NFT inscription surges, exchange batching, or market volatility — rather than recurring patterns [@harper2024bitcoin]. Fee data is marked by abrupt jumps and heavily influenced by off-chain events, making short-term fee selection a major challenge for users and infrastructure providers [@wang2025ordinals].

Prior work highlights network congestion and transaction complexity as critical drivers of transaction fees [@fan2020bitcoin]. However, existing tools like Bitcoin Core’s estimatesmartfee [@estimatesmartfee] and Mempool.space offer short-term, reactive guidance based on recent block data [@mempool], typically covering only the next 1–6 blocks. These methods are opaque, insensitive to external drivers of volatility, and provide no insight beyond the immediate horizon. Most public tools and research treat fee prediction as a static regression problem, overlooking the timing and structure of volatility — and leaving a critical planning gap unaddressed [@li2020survey].
