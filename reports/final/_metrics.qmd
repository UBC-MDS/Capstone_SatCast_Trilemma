## Evaluation Metrics

We used multiple metrics to evaluate model performance, selected to balance interpretability and relevance to fee volatility. MAPE was chosen for its intuitive, percentage-based output, helping stakeholders assess relative accuracy across fee levels. RMSE complemented this by penalizing large errors more heavily, making it better suited for detecting and differentiating sharp fee spikes—crucial for users aiming to avoid overpayment during congestion.

RMSE complemented this by penalizing large errors more heavily, making it better suited for detecting sharp spikes and for users seeking to avoid overpayment during congestion.

To address the limitations of standard loss functions in modeling Bitcoin fee spikes, we developed a custom composite loss tailored to the problem’s volatility-first nature. Traditional losses such as MAE tend to reward average accuracy while under-penalizing models that miss high-volatility patterns or smooth out sudden transitions. Recent literature underscores the need for shape- and time-aware loss functions: Le Guen & Thome propose a distortion-based loss aligned with temporal patterns [@leguen2019dilate], Wang et al. show improved spike detection using custom losses in extreme-value settings [@wang2024custom], and Lopez stresses aligning evaluation with volatility-driven business objectives [@lopez2001evaluating].

Inspired by these studies, we crafted a custom loss combining three components: base error (MAE), volatility mismatch (standard deviation loss), and spike timing deviation (difference in normalized series structure). This formulation explicitly encourages models to preserve both the timing and magnitude of fee surges—crucial for capturing event-driven Bitcoin congestion. A breakdown of the components is shown in @tbl-custom-loss.

| **Component**     | **Base Loss**            | **Std Loss**                | **Deviation Error**                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Calculation**   | `y_pred − y_true`        | `std_pred − std_true`       | `(y_pred − ȳ_pred) − (y_true − ȳ_true)`    |
| **Captures**   | Raw error                | Overall volatility mismatch | Dynamic (pointwise) pattern mismatch          |
| **Relevance to Spikes** | Underweights spikes | Penalizes smoothing         | Captures spike timing                     |

## Stakeholder Impact & Ethical Considerations

By prioritizing volatility and spike timing, our evaluation metrics better reflect key stakeholder needs. End users aim to avoid high-fee periods, wallet providers require timely and interpretable forecasts, and miners may optimize revenue with improved visibility. However, ethical risks exist: users may over-rely on predictions, forecasts may be exploited, and unequal access could widen fee disparities. We mitigate these issues through open access, transparent design, and clear communication of model limitations. Broader concerns like fairness, miner incentives, and malicious mempool behavior lie beyond our current scope and merit future attention.
