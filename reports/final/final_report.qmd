# The two files below are created via the analysis.py file. For reproducibility you can run this magic command above before moving forward. However, remember the SARIMA model is not in the github repo, you will have to fit a full SARIMA model before running this magic command as it is required in analysis.py. Go to Readme.md for instruction on how to train an SARIMA model on your local machine
