This challenge was initially raised by our capstone partner Trilemma Capital, whose mission focuses on serving industry talent and advancing Bitcoin infrastructure through data science. To bridge this gap, we started by examining the temporal structure of transaction fees, which revealed key challenges: strong daily cycles, right-skewed distributions, and sudden congestion spikes. These patterns exposed the limits of naïve point forecasts and motivated a shift toward volatility-aware, time-sensitive modeling. 

We therefore evaluated a range of models capturing diverse temporal dynamics: decomposition methods such as Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES) [@holt1957forecasting; @winters1960forecasting] and Prophet [@taylor2018prophet]; autoregressive model Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) [@box2015time]; tree-based learner XGBoost [@chen2016xgboost]; and deep learning architectures including DeepAR [@salinas2017deepar] and TFT [@lim2019temporal]. 

A central contribution of our work is a custom loss function designed to capture spike sensitivity and relative error fairness, addressing limitations of standard metrics like MAE and RMSE. This, along with lag-based features, careful preprocessing, and robust cross-validation, enabled more meaningful model comparison and a strong foundation for real-world deployment in volatile blockchain environments. Among the models tested, TFT consistently outperformed others, improving key evaluation metrics by `{python} f"{min_improvement_pct:.0f}%"`–`{python} f"{max_improvement_pct:.0f}%"` and demonstrating strong capacity to model irregular fee dynamics and support forward-looking decision-making.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows: @sec-techniques outlines the data science techniques used, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation strategy. @sec-product presents the data product and results, detailing model performance, intended use, and the system’s extensibility. @sec-conclusion concludes with key takeaways, limitations, and recommendations for future development.
