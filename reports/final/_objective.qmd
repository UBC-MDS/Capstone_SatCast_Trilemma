Our exploratory analysis revealed key challenges in fee forecasting: strong daily cycles, right-skewed distributions, and sudden congestion spikes. These patterns exposed the limitations of naive point forecasts and motivated a shift toward volatility-aware, time-sensitive modeling. To address this, we evaluated a diverse set of forecasting models reflecting different temporal dynamics: decomposition methods such as Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES) [@holt1957forecasting; @winters1960forecasting] and Prophet [@taylor2018prophet]; autoregressive model Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) [@box2015time]; tree-based learner XGBoost [@chen2016xgboost]; and deep learning architectures including DeepAR [@salinas2017deepar] and the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [@lim2019temporal]. 

A central contribution of our work is a custom loss function designed to capture spike sensitivity and relative error fairness, addressing limitations of standard metrics like MAE and RMSE. This, along with lag-based features, careful preprocessing, and robust cross-validation, enabled more meaningful model comparison and a strong foundation for real-world deployment in volatile blockchain environments. Among the models tested, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) consistently outperformed others, improving key evaluation metrics by 25–35% and demonstrating strong capacity to model irregular fee dynamics and support forward-looking decision-making.
