## Overview of the Data Product
This data product directly supports Trilemma Capital’s mission of serving industry talent and advancing Bitcoin infrastructure through data science, both educational and technical. Its design intentionally tailors to three core audiences. General users and institutions can rely on the 24-hour forecasts to plan transactions and reduce fee costs. Learners and educators receive a transparent, step-by-step walkthrough of Bitcoin-fee forecasting and time-series methodology. Industry experts and partners see infrastructure-grade modeling practice embodied in a modular pipeline and well-documented repository. 
The product is purposefully modular. Jupyter notebooks guide users through EDA, modeling decisions, and final TFT results. Python scripts implement a structured pipeline for reproducible experiments and easy re-training on new data. Finally, the open-source GitHub repository—with clear documentation—enables collaboration, scalability, and long-term extensibility.
