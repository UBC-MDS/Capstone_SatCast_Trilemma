Bitcoin transaction fees are highly volatile and event-driven, with annual spending exceeding billions and single-day spikes reaching over $78 million [@harper2024bitcoin]. Most existing tools provide only short-horizon, heuristic-based estimates for the next few blocks (<1 hour), offering limited foresight for users aiming to optimize transaction cost or timing. This project addresses that gap by forecasting fee volatility up to 24 hours ahead, with the primary goal of identifying high-volatility periods in the fastestFee tier and a secondary goal of estimating fee magnitude within those windows.

Multiple modeling approaches were explored, including classical time series methods, tree-based models, and deep learning architectures. Traditional models captured seasonality but failed to anticipate sharp spikes. The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) demonstrated the best performance, capturing complex dependencies and improving both RMSE and a custom volatility-sensitive loss by 25–35%. The final product is a modular forecasting system that combines narrative-driven notebooks with executable model pipelines and open-source infrastructure for ongoing development. While limitations remain—such as limited historical data, reliance on reactive features, and the computational cost of deep learning— the system provides a practical foundation for long-horizon fee forecasting and contributes to advancing infrastructure in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
