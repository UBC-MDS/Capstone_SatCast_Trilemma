Bitcoin transaction fees[^note] are highly volatile and event-driven, with annual spending exceeding billions and single-day spikes reaching over $78 million [@harper2024bitcoin]. Most existing tools provide only short-horizon, heuristic-based estimates for the next few blocks (<1 hour), offering limited foresight for users aiming to optimize transaction cost or timing. This project addresses that gap by forecasting fee volatility 24 hours in advance, with the primary goal of identifying high-volatility fee periods and a secondary goal of estimating fee levels within those windows.

We explored multiple modeling approaches, including classical time series methods, tree-based models, and deep learning architectures. Standard models captured trend and seasonality but smoothed over the sharp fee spikes that matter most in our context, which are statistical outliers but carry real world significance. To address this, we designed a custom composite loss function that accounts for spike shape, timing, volatility, and accuracy. Guided by this loss, the tailored Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) demonstrated the best performance, capturing complex dependencies and improving key evaluation metrics by 25â€“35%. Despite constraints such as limited historical coverage, lagging input features, and the computational demands of deep learning, the system provides a practical foundation for long-horizon fee forecasting and contributes to advancing infrastructure in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
