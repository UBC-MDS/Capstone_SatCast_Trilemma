## Data Overview

We use Bitcoin Mempool data [@mempool], which records hourly time series information about unconfirmed transactions waiting to be confirmed in the blockchain (@fig-mempool). The mempool acts as a dynamic queue, with transaction size represented by block space and fee ranges indicated by color, where red signals higher fees and green signals lower fees. This rich dataset provides the necessary historical context for building accurate fee rate forecasting models.

## Data Description

Our dataset (@tbl-description) consists of 11,902 hourly entries and 67 features across several categories relevant to fee prediction, including recommended fee rates, mempool statistics, fee histograms, mining difficulty adjustments, and price data in various fiat currencies. The projected data covers mempool blocks, transaction sizes, and associated fee ranges. Fee rate features include recommended fees for different confirmation targets (fastest, half-hour, hour, minimum, economy) and 37 binned fee categories based on transaction counts. Mempool statistics capture aggregate data like transaction count, virtual size (vsize), and total fees per time step. Difficulty adjustments include the current difficulty epoch, progress percentage, and estimated time to the next retarget event.
