The following section presents the workflow and provides a detailed project timeline for the duration of the capstone.

## Workflow

The workflow diagram (@fig-workflow) outlines the project's end-to-end structure, ensuring adherence to best data science practices. We begin with raw Bitcoin mempool data, followed by EDA, feature engineering, and model development. Next, we establish baseline models to set benchmarks and then progress to advanced models for improved accuracy and reliability. Ultimately, the best-performing model will be deployed to AWS for real-time fee prediction.

\hline
\textbf{Week} & \textbf{Milestone} \\
\hline
Week 1 & Write proposal report, conduct initial EDA, and create a full data specification notebook to document and visualize all available features and the target. \\
\hline
Week 2 & Train and evaluate baseline models, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and XGBoost; Use Linear Regression for exploratory analysis of external features. \\
\hline
Week 3 & Build advanced models such as Prophet, DeepAR, and Temporal Fusion Transformer. \\
\hline
Week 4 & Continue building advanced models if needed; test and compare their performance against baselines using standard metrics. \\
\hline
Week 5 & Perform timeframe optimization by analyzing model performance across the 24-hour forecast horizon. \\
\hline
Week 6 & Integrate modeling pipeline for AWS deployment; finalize deliverables and prepare for final presentation. \\
