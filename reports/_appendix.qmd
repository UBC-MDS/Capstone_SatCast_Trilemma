\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\
\hline
Bitcoin & Unit of currency is called "bitcoin" with a small b, and system is called "Bitcoin," with a capital B. "bitcoin" is a virtual currency (cryptocurrency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity (i.e. decentralized). \\
\hline
Bitcoin Address & “1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV” An encoded base58-check version of a public key 160-bit hash consists of a string of letters and numbers. Think of it analogous to an email address when sending someone an email. \\
\hline
Blockchain & A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers, making it transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Technology used by Bitcoin. \\
\hline
Fees & The sender of a transaction often includes a fee to the network for processing the requested transaction. Most transactions require a minimum fee of 0.5 mBTC (millibitcoin) = 0.0005 BTC. Typical unit measurement in satoshi/bytes. \\
\hline
Hash & A function that converts an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length. The hash is irreversible, meaning it cannot be decrypted back to the original input. Hashes are used in Bitcoin to create blocks and verify transactions. \\
\hline
Mempool & The bitcoin Mempool (memory pool) is a collection of all transaction data in a block that have been verified by Bitcoin nodes, but are not yet confirmed. \\
\hline
Mining / Miner & A process/network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing. \\
\hline
Node & Refers to blockchain stakeholders and their devices that keep a copy of the distributed ledger and serve as communication points within the network. Major purpose is to verify the validity of the transactions within a particular blockchain. \\
\hline
Proof-of-Work & A piece of data that requires significant computation to find; In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the difficulty target. \\
\hline
Satoshi & The smallest denomination of bitcoin that can be recorded on the blockchain. 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to 100 million satoshis, named after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. \\
